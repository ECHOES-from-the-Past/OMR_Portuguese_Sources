# OMR_Portuguese_Sources

Resources for the Optical Music Recognition (OMR) for Iberian Aquitanian and Iberian square notations as found in manuscripts:
- [Salamanca Missal, E-SAu Ms. 2637 (ACm)](https://pemdatabase.eu/source/48357) in _Iberian Aquitanian notation_
- [P-BRs Ms. 034](https://pemdatabase.eu/source/47612) in _Iberian square notation_

Aquitanian notation is characterized by the use of a single music reference line and no clefs.

Iberian square notation has some differences when compared to regular??? square notation:
1. Some extra symbols (e.g., the lengüeta, which implies a repeated note)
   - Lengüeta up:

   - Lengüeta down:

2. Some symbols that are used with a different functionality (e.g., the one that looks as a plica is not representing a liquescent, but a repeated note)
   - Looks like a plica
