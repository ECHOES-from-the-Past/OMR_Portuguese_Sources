## The Case of Iberian Aquitanian and Square notations

### Iberian Square Notation
Iberian square notation has some differences when compared to regular??? square notation:
1. Some extra symbols. For example, the lengueta, which implies a repeated note and looks like:

   <img src="./resources/4_mei_encoding/_images/square/SQlenguetaup.jpg" width="56p" alt="LenguetaUp"/>  ![LenguetaDown](./resources/4_mei_encoding/_images/square/lenguetadown.png)
     
2. Some symbols that are used with a different functionality. For example, the following symbol that looks like a plica but it is not representing a liquescent, but a repeated note.

### Iberian Aquitanian Notation
Aquitanian notation is characterized by the use of a single music reference line and no clefs.
