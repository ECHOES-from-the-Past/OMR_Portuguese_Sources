# MEI Encoding Resources

This folder contains the resources needed for the MEI Encoding job in Rodan. The MEI Encoding job needs a CSV file mapping the class names used in the Interactive (or Non-Interactive) Classifier job to the right MEI encoding for the symbols that fall into these classes. See columns `classification` and `mei` for the name of the classes and their MEI code, respectively.

There are two CSV files here (together with their corresponding Excel files that show the images of the symbols classified):
- One for Iberian Aquitanian notation, based on the [Salamanca Missal, E-SAu Ms. 2637 (ACm)](https://pemdatabase.eu/source/48357)
- One for Iberian Square notation, based on the Manuscripts [P-BRs Ms. 028](https://pemdatabase.eu/source/48438), [P-BRs Ms. 032](https://pemdatabase.eu/source/47990), and [P-BRs Ms. 034](https://pemdatabase.eu/source/47612)
