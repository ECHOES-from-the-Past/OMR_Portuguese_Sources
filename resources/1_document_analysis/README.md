# Document Analysis Resources

The two folders `Iberian_aquitanian_notation` and `Iberian_square_notation` contain two directories inside:

- The **`pixel_ground_truth_data` folder** containing the layers of fully classified folios using the Pixel.js job in Rodan.

- The **`models` folder** for the models trained for pixel classification of the manuscript using the `Training model for Parchwise Analysis of Music Document, Training` job (also known as "Paco's Training" job for its author) and the data from `pixel_ground_truth_data`. This folder also shows the prediction of these models in the image they were trained (see `classify_same_page` folder) and in a new image (see `classify_new_page` folder).
